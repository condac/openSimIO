// Refresh interval. This will read and resend all inputs to fix issues where switches are in one position and xplane is reloaded and think it is another position
// It will trigger a resend every ms defined by REFRESH_TIME but only for one value at the time. So if you have 20 inputs configured setting REFRESH_TIME to 1000 will take 20s for all values to have be resent.
// If you want to be able to control switches from within the game and not have them overwritten uncomment this.
